}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Generation Time
- **HTML Reports**: ~1-3 seconds
- **PDF Reports**: ~3-10 seconds (depending on content)
- **Large Reports**: May take longer with many jobs/sections

### File Sizes
- **HTML**: 50-200 KB typically
- **PDF**: 200KB-2MB depending on content and images
- **Charts**: Add ~50-100KB to PDF files

### Optimization Tips
- Limit matched jobs to top 10-20 for faster generation
- Use minimal sections for quick reports
- Consider HTML for immediate viewing, PDF for formal sharing
